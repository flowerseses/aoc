not really a proof but

given the setup in day16 aoc 2023 (https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/16):

assume horizontal line y=a where 0<=a<rows and two paths on that line defined by unit vectors v1=(1, 0) and v2=(-1, 0).
if paths defined by the vectors v1 and v2 overlap at p1=(x, y), can we prove that there exists no point p such that p lies on y=a, p is part of path v1 and p is not part of path v2?

assuming such a point exists demands that v2 extends past the start of v1 (or vice versa). given that a path can only start by:
being split (in which case it has to extend to a stopping point in both directions),
reflected (in which case the incoming path also has to be reflected in the same way) or
by starting at an edge
the only possible option for such point to exist is for it to be x'=(-1, y), which is outside of the defined line
